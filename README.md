Track details on encounters throughout run

See https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker/wiki/Tracker-Add-ons for details on tracker add ons.

This can be added to your tracker by copying [EncounterDetails.lua](./EncounterDetails.lua) into the trackers `/extensions` folder, and then enabling it in the game through the settings menu.

In the extension screen, there are two options;

* remove the pig from the opposing pokemon in the battle screen (the text below it saying when it was last encountered can still be used to enter the screen)
* track trainer encounters instead of all encounters.

If you are outside of battle, you can still look up pokemon details from the extension details screen:
